# 🧾 Receiptly

https://receiptly.cookjp.com

Receiptly is a modern web application that helps you scan and split receipts easily. It uses OCR technology to extract text from receipt images, allows you to edit the extracted data, and provides a simple way to split expenses among multiple people.
## 🚀 Features

    Receipt Scanning: Upload or capture receipt images

    Text Extraction: OCR processing to extract items and prices

    Receipt Editing: Correct any OCR mistakes inline

    Bill Splitting: Add people and attribute items to them

    Split Calculation: Automatically calculate how much each person owes

## ⚙️ How It Works

    Scan a Receipt: Upload an image or take a photo of your receipt

    Review & Edit: Make any corrections to the extracted text and prices

    Add People: Enter the names of everyone splitting the bill

    Assign Items: Select who's paying for what items

    View Results: See a detailed breakdown of how much each person owes

## ✅ TODO

    - Save state. ✅
    - Improve image deciphering (AI)?
    - Shareable link for each person to tick off their items ✅
    - Check Service Charge calculation is working
    - Make subtotal just be the sum of items. and check that against the total
    - Light mode support (checkboxes are hard to see)
    - Update Receipt items and people on session (supports going back)
    - setup CI/CD to VPS (docker-compose?)
